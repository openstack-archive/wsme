No user-facing bug fixes or features over what 0.5b3 provides.

0.5b3 (2013-09-04)
------------------

The project moved to stackforge. Mind the new URLs for the repository, bug
report etc (see the documentation).

*   Allow non-default status code return with the pecan adapter
    (Angus Salked).

*   Fix returning objects with object attributes set to None on rest-json
    & ExtDirect.

    on the pecan adapter.

*   Make the code PEP8 compliant (Ryan Petrello).

0.5b2 (2013-04-18)
------------------

*   Changed the way datas of complex types are stored. In previous versions, an
    attribute was added to the type for each attribute, its name being the
    attribute name prefixed with '_'.

    Starting with this version, a single attribute _wsme_dataholder is added to
    the instance.

    The motivation behind this change is to avoid adding too many attributes to
    the object.

*   Add a special type 'HostRequest' that allow a function to ask for the host
    framework request object in its arguments.

*   Pecan adapter: Debug mode (which returns the exception tracebacks to the
    client) can be enabled by the pecan application configuration.

*   New adapter: wsmeext.flask, for the Flask_ framework.

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/

*   Fix: the cornice adapter was not usable.

*   Fix: Submodules of wsmeext were missing in the packages.

*   Fix: The demo app was still depending on the WSME-Soap package (which has
    been merged into WSME in 0.5b1).

*   Fix: A function with only on 'body' parameter would fail when being called.

*   Fix: Missing arguments were poorly reported by the frameworks adapters.

0.5b1 (2013-01-30)
------------------

*   Introduce a new kind of adapters that rely on the framework routing.
    Adapters are provided for Pecan, TurboGears and cornice.

*   Reorganised the rest protocol implementation to ease the implementation of
    adapters that rely only on the host framework routing system.

*   The default rest ``@expose`` decorator does not wrap the decorated function
    anymore. If needed to expose a same function several times, a parameter
    ``multiple_expose=True`` has been introduced.

*   Remove the wsme.release module

*   Fix == operator on ArrayType

*   Adapted the wsme.sphinxext module to work with the function exposed by the
    ``wsme.pecan`` adapter.
   
*   Allow promotion of ``int`` to ``float`` on float attributes (Doug Hellman)

*   Add a ``samples_slot`` option to the ``.. autotype`` directive to
    choose where the data samples whould be inserted (Doug Hellman).

*   Add ``sample()`` to ArrayType and DictType (Doug Hellman).

*   New syntax for object arrays as GET parameters, without brackets. Ex:
    ``?o.f1=a&o.f1=b&o.f2=c&o.f2=d`` is an array of two objects:
    [{'f1': 'a', 'f2': 'c']}, {'f1': 'b', 'f2': 'd']}.

*   @signature (and its @wsexpose frontends) has a new parameter:
    ``ignore_extra_args``.

*   Fix boolean as input type support in the soap implementation (Craig
    McDaniel).

*   Fix empty/nil strings distinction in soap (Craig McDaniel).

*   Improved unittests code coverage.

*   Ported the soap implementation to python 3.

*   Moved non-core features (adapters, sphinx extension) to the ``wsmeext`` module.

*   Change the GET parameter name for passing the request body as a parameter
    is now from 'body' to '__body__'

*   The soap, extdirect and sqlalchemy packages have been merged into the main
    package.

*   Changed the documentation theme to "Cloud".

0.4 (2012-10-15)
----------------

*   Automatically converts unicode strings to/from ascii bytes.

*   Use d2to1 to simplify setup.py.

*   Implements the SPORE specification.

*   Fixed a few things in the documentation

0.4b1 (2012-09-14)
------------------

*   Now supports Python 3.2

*   String types handling is clearer.

*   New :class:`wsme.types.File` type.

*   Supports cross-referenced types.

*   RESTful protocol can now use the http method.

*   UserTypes can now be given a name that will be used in the
    documentation.

*   Complex types can inherit :class:`wsme.types.Base`. They will
    have a default constructor and be registered automatically.

*   Removed the wsme.wsgi.adapt function if favor of
    :meth:`wsme.WSRoot.wsgiapp`

*   Now handle dict and UserType types as GET/POST params.

*   Better handling of application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoded POSTs
    in rest protocols.

------------------

------------------

*   Added batch-calls abilities.

*   Introduce a :class:`UnsetType` and a :data:`Unset` constant
    so that non-mandatory attributes can remain unset (which is
    different from null).

*   Fix: If a complex type was only used as an input type, it was
    not registered.

*   Add support for user types.

*   Add an Enum type (which is a user type).

*   The 'binary' type is now a user type.

*   Complex types:

    -   Fix inspection of complex types with inheritance.

    -   Fix inspection of self-referencing complex types.

    -   wsattr is now a python Descriptor, which makes it possible
        to retrieve the attribute definition on a class while
        manipulating values on the instance.
    
    -   Add strong type validation on assignment (made possible by
        the use of Descriptors).

*   ExtDirect:

    -   Implements batch calls

    -   Fix None values conversion

    -   Fix transaction result : 'action' and 'method' were missing.

0.1.1 (2011-10-20)
------------------

*   Changed the internal API by introducing a CallContext object.
    It makes it easier to implement some protocols that have
    a transaction or call id that has to be returned. It will also
    make it possible to implement batch-calls in a later version.

*   More test coverage.

*   Fix a problem with array attribute types not being registered.

*   Fix the mandatory / default detection on function arguments.

*   Fix issues with the SOAP protocol implementation which should now

    have a simple adapt function that adapt a :class:`wsme.WSRoot`
    instance. This way a same root can be integrated in several
    framework.

*   Protocol lookup now use entry points in the group ``[wsme.protocols]``.

0.1.0a3 (2011-10-11)

    TurboGears 1.x controller (:class:`wsme.tg1.WSRoot`).

*   Improve the documentation.

*   More unit tests and code-coverage.
